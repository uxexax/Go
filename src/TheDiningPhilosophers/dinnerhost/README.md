The **host** of the dinner takes care of the whole dinner:

* When a philosopher arrives, it registers them and reserves a seat for them.
* Makes decision if a philosopher requesting dinner can start eating or not, based on the host's internal data.
* It is also the host who takes care of the chopstick reservations.
* If a philosopher is not allowed to eat anymore, the host ask them to leave.
