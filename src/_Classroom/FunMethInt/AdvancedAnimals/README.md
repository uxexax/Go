This is a coursework, an exercise of interfaces. The program allows to create animals with name (command `newanimal <name> <animal>`), and retrieve certain information about them via command line (command `query <name> <information>`). The possible animals are *cow*, *bird* and *snake* which are implemented as individual classes, having the interface Animal. Information can be *eat*, *move* or *speak*.
