A variable is changed with the same value at regular intervals while it is also sampled at regular intervals. This is done in multiple rounds, with the same changing and sampling intervals in every round. As a result of the race condition caused by simultaneously writing and reading the same variable from different goroutines, the sampled values cannot be predicted and the samples of subsequent rounds will be different.
